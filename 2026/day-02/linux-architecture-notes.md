Task
Today’s goal is to understand how Linux works under the hood.

You will create a short note that explains:

- The core components of Linux (kernel, user space, init/systemd)
- How processes are created and managed
- What systemd does and why it matters
- This is the foundation for all troubleshooting you will do as a DevOps engineer.
