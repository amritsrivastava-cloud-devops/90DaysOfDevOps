# Day 07 – Linux File System Hierarchy & Scenario-Based Practice

# Part 1 

- Linux File System Heirarchy

- / (root)
- This is the top-level directory. Every file and directory in Linux starts from here.
- Example content: bin, etc, home
- I would use this when I want to understand the overall system structure.

- /home
- Contains home directories for normal users.
- Example content: /home/user, documents, downloads
- I would use this when managing user files and permissions.

- /root
- Home directory of the root (admin) user.
- Example content: root-owned scripts and configs
- I would use this when performing administrative tasks as root.

- /etc

- Stores system-wide configuration files.
- Example content: hostname, hosts
- I would use this when configuring services or system settings.

- /var/log
- Contains log files generated by services and the system.
- Example content: syslog, auth.log
- I would use this when troubleshooting errors and service issues.

- /tmp
- Stores temporary files created by applications.
- Example content: temporary cache files
- I would use this for short-lived files that don’t need persistence.

- /bin
- Contains essential command binaries needed for basic system operation.
- Example content: ls, cp
- I would use this when running basic Linux commands.

- /usr/bin
- Contains user-level command binaries.
- Example content: docker, git
- I would use this when executing installed applications.

- /opt
- Used for optional or third-party software installations.
- Example content: /opt/google, /opt/custom-app
- I would use this when installing external applications.

## Hands on Task 

- Find the largest log file in /var/log
- Command: du -sh /var/log/* 2>/dev/null | sort -h | tail -5

- Look at a config file in /etc
- Command: cat /etc/hostname

- Check your home directory
- Command: ls -la

# Part 2

## Scenario-Based Practice 

- Question: How do you check if the 'nginx' service is running?
- Check service status
- Command: systemctl status nginx

- If service is not found, list all services
- Command: systemctl list-units --type=service

<img width="2388" height="1586" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b686305d-13c0-4524-a40f-709379f5082a" />

- Check if service is enabled on boot
- Command: systemctl is-enabled nginx

<img width="1150" height="154" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8a46a8b-6eb6-4682-ac85-9993f96b61c8" />

## Scenario 1 - A web application service called 'myapp' failed to start after a server reboot. What commands would you run to diagnose the issue? Write at least 4 commands in order.

- I am taking nginx for further diagnostics .
- Checking current status
- Command: systemctl status nginx

<img width="2376" height="734" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80911fde-4ca4-46cc-b406-487b0d81b335" />

- What do log say ?
- Command: journalctl -u myapp -n 50

- Is it enabled to start on boot?
- Command: systemctl is-enabled nginx

<img width="1164" height="172" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329f922d-fb66-4047-bd42-50be39b54d8e" />

## Scenario 2 - Your manager reports that the application server is slow. You SSH into the server. What commands would you run to identify , which process is using high CPU?

- to view high usages resource in system
Command: top
- To list the top CPU-consuming processes in sorted order.
- Command: ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10

## Scenario 3 - Finding Service Logs - A developer asks: "Where are the logs for the 'docker' service?" The service is managed by systemd. What commands would you use?

- To confirm service status and see log hints.
- Command: systemctl status docker

<img width="2932" height="880" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aba6dd13-5c3c-4cfd-9d73-41206e910626" />

- To view recent Docker service logs.
- Command: journalctl -n docker -u 50

<img width="2938" height="626" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bafbddf5-3276-410d-b3aa-73e99bb736e0" />

- To follow logs in real-time
- Command: journalctl -u docker -f

## Scenario 4 - File permission issue - A script at /home/user/backup.sh is not executing. When you run it: ./backup.sh . You get: "Permission denied"
- What commands would you use to fix this?

- Step 1: Check current permissions
- Command: ls -l /home/user/backup.sh
- Look for: -rw-r--r-- (notice no 'x' = not executable)

- Step 2: Add execute permission
- Command: chmod +x /home/user/backup.sh

- Step 3: Verify it worked
- Command: ls -l /home/user/backup.sh
- Look for: -rwxr-xr-x (notice 'x' = executable)

- Step 4: Try running it
- Command: ./backup.sh
