# Day 27 – GitHub Profile Makeover (Execution Guide)

Your GitHub profile is your **public proof of work**. Anyone opening it should instantly understand:

* who you are
* what you’re learning
* how serious you are about DevOps

---

## Task 1: GitHub Profile Audit (What to Write in Notes)

Add this section to `day-27-notes.md` 👇

```md
## GitHub Profile Audit (Before)

- Profile picture: ❌ Casual / Default / Not professional
- Bio: ❌ Empty / Too generic / Not DevOps-focused
- Pinned repositories: ❌ Random / Forks / Empty repos
- Repository descriptions: ❌ Missing or unclear
- Overall impression: ❌ Recruiter would not clearly understand my learning journey
```

📌 Be honest. This makes your **before vs after** strong.

---

## Task 2: Profile README (MOST IMPORTANT)

### Step 1: Create Special Repo

Repo name **must exactly match your username** on **GitHub**.

Example:

```
username/username
```

Add `README.md`

---

### Step 2: Copy This Profile README Template

✅ **Clean | Recruiter-friendly | DevOps-focused**

```md

## Pro Tip (Recruiter Psychology 🧠)

A clean GitHub tells recruiters:

> “This person finishes what they start and documents their work.”

That alone puts you **ahead of 70% candidates**.
